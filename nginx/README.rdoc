= Nginx Plugin

Monitors nginx's memory utilization, requests-per-second and connections stats.

Statistics is based on internal stub module which ships with the source code by default.

* Language: Perl
* Authors: Ant√≥nio P. P. Almeida <appa@perusio.net>

== Requirements

You'll need to install libwww-perl module (if not installed)

  apt-get install libwww-perl

== Configuration

You'll need to include additional module when building from source:

  ./configure YOUR_OPTS --with-http_stub_status_module
  
Then you need to add or create a virtual host to serve munin plugin on localhost:
 
  server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;
  
    location /nginx_status {
      stub_status on;
      access_log off;
      allow 127.0.0.1;
      deny all;
    }
  }

Make sure to restart/reload your server after those changes.

Now, test it (via curl):

  curl http://localhost/nginx_status
  
  # Should respond with similar data
  Active connections: 128 
  server accepts handled requests

== Integration

Edit /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node and add the lines

 [nginx*]
 env.url http://localhost/nginx_status
 
Restart munin-node with

  sudo /etc/init.d/munin-node restart
  
And statistics should be available in 5 minutes.
